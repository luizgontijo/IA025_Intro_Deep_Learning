# IA025_Intro_Deep_Learning

Repository used in Unicamp's introductory deep learning course.

All implementations were done using PyTorch.

The main topics covered during the course were:
- Implementation from scratch of perceptrons and larger architectures using convolutional layers;
- Implementation from scratch of a ResNet resitual block;
- Approach to convolutional networks in NLP;
- Implementation from scratch of a Attention block with anda withou causal mask;
- A final project using T5 transformer model to generate captions for several images.
